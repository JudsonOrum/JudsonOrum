👋 Hi, I'm Judson Orum, a passionate programmer and avid learner. I'm always on the lookout for exciting opportunities to expand my skills and collaborate with like-minded individuals. 
 
👀 I'm interested in a variety of programming-related topics, including web development, data science, and machine learning. I'm also interested in exploring new technologies and frameworks to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry. 
 
🌱 Currently, I'm focusing on improving my skills in Python, HTML, and JavaScript. I'm also exploring the world of data analysis and visualization using tools like Pandas and Matplotlib. 
 
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects that have the potential to make a positive impact in the world. Whether it's building a new web application or contributing to an existing project, I'm always eager to work with others to create something meaningful.
